            <p>
              From social media apps and an increasing number of industries that
              rely on computer code, learning coding and computer language
              skills will set your child up to have a very bright future, and
              they’ll have fun too.

            <h3>Boost Their Job Prospects</h3>
            <p>
              According to Code.org, computer science jobs are on the rise.
              Swapping gaming for coding will be hugely advantageous for your
              child, boosting their job prospects and earning potential,
              regardless of their chosen industry.

            <p>
              Thanks to a combination of logic and quick-fire calculations, your
              child can significantly improve their mathematical ability without
              even realising through coding.

            <h3>Foster Creativity</h3>
            <p>
              While gaming is fun, coding allows your child to design something
              from scratch. This is a fantastic way for a child to develop and
              exercise their creativity, and seeing something entirely their own
              come to life is a great motivator to keep learning.

            <h3>Brilliant Scratch Course!</h3>
            <p>
              Great company! Very friendly and helpful bookings agents. I must
              also say great customer service! The free taster session was a
              great way to see what the course would be like. The course itself
              was everything we were looking for, we found that being able to
              message our tutor on Whatsapp was a huge bonus.

            <h3>Great course learning valuable skills for the future</h3>
            <p>
              My 12 year old is really loving this course and he's learning a
              lot. He's always so enthusiastic after each lesson, showing me
              what he's learnt. What's great is that he gets proper tuition with
              an actual tutor who's present for the whole of each lesson. The
              taster session was really useful too to - great to be able to try
              before you buy. We'll definitely be considering doing more modules
              in the future.

            <h3>My son who is 12 enjoyed learning from…</h3>
            <p>
              My son who is 12 enjoyed learning from them, we had great
              experience and he learnt python from them. The team kept parents
              up to date related to child’s progress and what they taught in
              every lesson. I would definitely recommend them.
